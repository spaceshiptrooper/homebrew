    tds: Fix use-after-free in TLS code

    tds_close_socket and tds_connection_close could have been called
    while reading/writing TLS sockets so calling tds_ssl_deinit
    cause some used structure to be released while used.

    Parse and fix correctly IPv6 addresses in parse_server_name_for_port

    This fixes https://github.com/FreeTDS/freetds/issues/470.

    If [] quoting was used for IPv6 literal addresses the name was
    not correctly unquoted causing failure resolving the name.

    tds: Fix for change in OpenSSL 1.1.1l

    Some strings in OpenSSL 1.1.1l are not NUL terminated as in 1.1.1k.
    This was causing a wrong check for hostname causing failure connecting
    to database.
    Terminate always extracted hostname string to avoid this issue.

    Use unaligned access in replacement iconv

    System iconv does not enforce aligned access.
    Also this could happen reading/writing directly to TDS packets.

    Do not install odbcss.h if already in the system

    The provided include is supposed to export some defines that
    should be already be defined by windows headers.
    If they are available they should be used instead.
    This fixed conflict with systems like Windows and possibly MingW.

    tds/convert.c: Fix floating-point -> integer bounds.

    - Use distinct macros for integer and FP source types as needed.
    - Use power-of-two upper bounds with < when FP source types are a
      consideration, to account for pre-conversion truncation or possible
      precision loss as appropriate.
    - Account for pre-conversion truncation (NOT floor computation) of
      negative FP values and for possible limited precision around the
      lower bounds of 32- and 64-bit signed integer types.
    - Per Freddy, don't bother with explicit l suffixes; 16-bit systems
      are not relevant to FreeTDS.

    Not found using directly a SQL Server database but with some

    The TLS inside TDS packet was not ending with the handshake
