**Sphinx makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation.**

Sphinx uses reStructuredText as its markup language, and many of its strengths
come from the power and straightforwardness of reStructuredText and its parsing
and translating suite, the Docutils.

Features
========

* **Output formats**: HTML, PDF, plain text, EPUB, TeX, manual pages, and more
* **Extensive cross-references**: semantic markup and automatic links
  for functions, classes, glossary terms and similar pieces of information
* **Hierarchical structure**: easy definition of a document tree, with automatic
  links to siblings, parents and children
* **Automatic indices**: general index as well as a module index
* **Code highlighting**: automatic highlighting using the Pygments highlighter
* **Templating**: Flexible HTML output using the Jinja 2 templating engine
* **Extension ecosystem**: Many extensions are available, for example for
  automatic function documentation or working with Jupyter notebooks.
* **Language Support**: Python, C, C++, JavaScript, mathematics, and many other
  languages through extensions.
