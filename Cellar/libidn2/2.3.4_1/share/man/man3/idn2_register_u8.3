.SH NAME
idn2_register_u8 \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <idn2.h>
.sp
.BI "int idn2_register_u8(const uint8_t * " ulabel ", const uint8_t * " alabel ", uint8_t ** " insertname ", int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const uint8_t * ulabel" 12
input zero\-terminated UTF\-8 and Unicode NFC string, or NULL.
.IP "const uint8_t * alabel" 12
input zero\-terminated ACE encoded string (xn\-\-), or NULL.
.IP "uint8_t ** insertname" 12
newly allocated output variable with name to register in DNS.
.IP "int flags" 12
optional \fBidn2_flags\fP to modify behaviour.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Perform IDNA2008 register string conversion on domain label  \fIulabel\fP and  \fIalabel\fP , as described in section 4 of RFC 5891.  Note that the
input  \fIulabel\fP must be encoded in UTF\-8 and be in Unicode NFC form.

Pass \fBIDN2_NFC_INPUT\fP in  \fIflags\fP to convert input  \fIulabel\fP to NFC form
before further processing.

It is recommended to supply both  \fIulabel\fP and  \fIalabel\fP for better
error checking, but supplying just one of them will work.  Passing
in only  \fIalabel\fP is better than only  \fIulabel\fP .  See RFC 5891 section
4 for more information.

After version 0.11:  \fIinsertname\fP may be NULL to test conversion of  \fIsrc\fP without allocating memory.
.SH "RETURNS"
On successful conversion \fBIDN2_OK\fP is returned, when the
given  \fIulabel\fP and  \fIalabel\fP does not match each other
\fBIDN2_UALABEL_MISMATCH\fP is returned, when either of the input
labels are too long \fBIDN2_TOO_BIG_LABEL\fP is returned, when  \fIalabel\fP does does not appear to be a proper A\-label \fBIDN2_INVALID_ALABEL\fP
is returned, or another error code is returned.
