.SH NAME
idn2_to_ascii_lz \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <idn2.h>
.sp
.BI "int idn2_to_ascii_lz(const char * " input ", char ** " output ", int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const char * input" 12
zero terminated input UTF\-8 string.
.IP "char ** output" 12
pointer to newly allocated output string.
.IP "int flags" 12
optional \fBidn2_flags\fP to modify behaviour.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Convert a domain name in locale's encoding to ASCII string using the IDNA2008
rules.  The domain name may contain several labels, separated by dots.
The output buffer must be deallocated by the caller.

The default behavior of this function (when flags are zero) is to apply
the IDNA2008 rules without the TR46 amendments. As the TR46
non\-transitional processing is nowadays ubiquitous, when unsure, it is
recommended to call this function with the \fBIDN2_NONTRANSITIONAL\fP
and the \fBIDN2_NFC_INPUT\fP flags for compatibility with other software.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBIDN2_OK\fP on success, or error code.
Same as described in \fBidn2_lookup_ul()\fP documentation.
.SH "SINCE"
2.0.0
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
